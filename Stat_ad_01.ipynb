    "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?  \n",
    "   - A variable that represents numerical outcomes of a random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the types of random variables?  \n",
    "   - Discrete: Takes specific values (e.g., number of heads in coin flips).  \n",
    "   - Continuous: Takes infinite values within a range (e.g., height, temperature).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?  \n",
    "   - Discrete: Uses a Probability Mass Function (PMF), sum of probabilities = 1.  \n",
    "   - Continuous: Uses a Probability Density Function (PDF), integrates to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?  \n",
    "   - Functions describing the probability of different values in a continuous distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?  \n",
    "   - PDF: Probability at a specific point.  \n",
    "   - CDF: Cumulative probability up to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?  \n",
    "   - A distribution where all outcomes have equal probability (e.g., rolling a fair die).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?  \n",
    "   - Models a single trial with success/failure.  \n",
    "   - Mean = \\( p \\), Variance = \\( p(1 - p) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?  \n",
    "   - Models multiple Bernoulli trials.  \n",
    "   - Used for success/failure counts (e.g., coin flips).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?  \n",
    "   - Models rare events in a fixed interval.  \n",
    "   - Used in traffic flow, call arrivals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?  \n",
    "    - A range \\([a, b]\\) where all values are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?  \n",
    "    - Bell-shaped curve.  \n",
    "    - Mean = Median = Mode.  \n",
    "    - Follows the 68-95-99.7 rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?  \n",
    "    - Mean = 0, Variance = 1.  \n",
    "    - Used for Z-score standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical?  \n",
    "    - Regardless of original distribution, sample means approximate a normal distribution as sample size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How does the CLT relate to the normal distribution?  \n",
    "    - CLT explains why normal distributions commonly appear in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?  \n",
    "    - Helps compare sample data to population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?  \n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "    \\]  \n",
    "    Measures how far a value is from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?  \n",
    "    - Point estimate: Single value estimation.  \n",
    "    - Interval estimate: Range with confidence level.\n",
